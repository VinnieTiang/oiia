# Chat-Based AI Assistant: Grablet 
## 1. Solution Overview
### Objective
Empower Grab merchant-partners with a proactive, voice-first AI assistant that delivers real-time insights, automates workflows, and bridges language/digital literacy gaps in Southeast Asia.

### Key Features (TODO)
- **Voice-First Design**:
  - Integrated speech-to-text (Whisper API) and text-to-speech (ElevenLabs/OpenAI) for a hands-free chatbot experience.
  - Multilingual support: English, Malay, and Chinese (prototype) â€” scalable to other Southeast Asian languages.
- **Real-Time Business Analytics**:
  - **Smart Sales Dashboard**:
    - Visualizes daily, weekly, and monthly performance
    - Highlights top-selling items, peak hours, and predicts upcoming sales trends using Prophet
  - **Intelligent Inventory Management**:
    - Auto real-time low-stock detection and alert with restock suggestions
    - Potential auto-supplier ordering (?)
- **AI-Driven Insights**
  - **Business Advice Engine**:
    - Combines GPT-3.5 with a custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) system to generate contextual insights from transactional data
  - **Competitive Leaderboards**:
    - Ranks merchants by sales/ratings across different scopes (Overall, Nearby, Category)
- **Accessibility Design**:
  - **Low-Literacy Optimization**:
    - Clear visuals, data-driven charts
    - Simple one-tap actions for smooth interaction
- **Feedback-Driven Learning**:
  - User can rate AI responses as "Good" or "Bad" with a single tap
  - Feedback is used to fine-tune future suggestions, making the system more personalized, reliable, and aligned with merchant needs

## 3. Data Utilization & Personalization
### Data Used
We utilize the following datasets to provide personalized, data-driven recommendations and insights for merchant-partners:

- **Transaction Data**: Used to analyze sales trends, calculate earnings, and determine peak business hours.
- **Transaction Items**: Enables identification of top-selling products, low-performing items, and customer preferences.
- **Merchant Data**: Supports personalized suggestions based on business type, size, location, and maturity level.
- **Items Metadata**: Helps detect underperforming items, manage inventory, and identify trending products.
- **Keywords**: Enhances searchability, trend detection, and product discovery through natural language analysis.

### Personalization Features

- Custom insights tailored to each merchant's business characteristics and performance metrics.
- Adaptive responses that consider merchant behavior, sales history, and inventory patterns.
- Recommendations for improving item conversion, adding trending items, or revising underperforming products.
- Multilingual support (English, Malay, Chinese) and localized feedback.
- Voice input support using Whisper API for more intuitive communication.

### Achieved Enhancements

Weâ€™ve successfully implemented several planned future features, including:

- âœ… Real-time analytics and summary of key metrics (e.g., earnings, top items, peak hours)
- âœ… Personalized AI-driven advice for business improvement
- âœ… Multilingual, chat-based interaction with voice support
- âœ… Identification of business opportunities like "popular but unbought" items
- âœ… Item recommendation system based on keyword trends and merchant type

## 5. Business Model

We have identified three key business model strategies to monetize the merchant assistant while delivering strong operational value. Each strategy is designed to drive revenue, increase merchant engagement, and deepen ecosystem integration.

### In-App Ingredient Restock via GrabMart Integration ðŸ›’

- Transforms the assistant into a revenue-generating channel by enabling direct ingredient restocking when low inventory is detected.
- Orders are fulfilled via GrabMart, driving traffic and transactions within Grabâ€™s own ecosystem instead of external suppliers.
- Builds merchant reliance on the assistant for daily operations, increasing stickiness and platform retention.
- Converts operational utility into long-term business value by embedding GrabMart as a core part of the merchantâ€™s workflow.

### Freemium to Premium Plan ðŸŒŸ

- Provides basic features for free to drive adoption, then encourages upgrades by locking high-value features behind a premium paywall.
- Premium includes personalized insights, unlimited assistant usage, and forecasting toolsâ€”essential for serious merchants to optimize operations.
- This tiered model balances reach and monetization, ensuring wide user acquisition while capturing revenue from power users.
- Increases merchant lifetime value (LTV) as they grow and transition from freemium to premium based on evolving needs.

### Transaction-Based Commission Model ðŸ’°

- Generates revenue by taking a small commission on every restock order placed through the assistant.
- Monetization is directly tied to merchant activity, creating a scalable and performance-based income stream.
- The model is non-intrusiveâ€”merchants benefit from convenience while Grab earns passively in the background.
- Increased merchant engagement directly fuels revenue growth, creating a flywheel effect where the assistantâ€™s usefulness drives adoption, and adoption drives monetization.

## 6. Future Improvement
- **AI & Prediction Enhancements**:
  - Replace Prophet with Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) model to better capture complex patterns in merchant's transaction data
- **Language Expansion**:
  - Support more Southeast Asian languages, dialects and slangs
- **Stronger Personalization**:
  - Learn from user behavior to refine insights
